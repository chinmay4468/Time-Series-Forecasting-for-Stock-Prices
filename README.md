Time Series Forecasting for Stock Prices
Overview
This project implements a time series forecasting model using Python and Prophet to predict stock price movements. The project also includes data visualization using Power BI to present forecasted results and stock trends for actionable insights. The model forecasts future stock prices based on historical data and visualizes the results to aid in decision-making.

Project Structure
Python Scripts: Implements the time series forecasting model using Prophet.
Power BI Dashboard: Visualizes the forecasted stock prices and trends.
Data: Includes historical stock data for model training and testing.
Key Features
Data Processing: Utilizes Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
Time Series Forecasting: Uses Prophet for forecasting stock prices based on historical data.
Visualization: Power BI is used to build dynamic dashboards, displaying the forecast and trends.
How to Run the Project
Python Scripts:
Install necessary Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Python script to train the model and generate predictions.
Power BI Dashboard:
Open the stock_forecasting.pbix file in Power BI.
Connect it to the CSV file with the forecasted data and visualize the results.
